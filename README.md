# zypper-overlay

## NOTE：This overlay is porting openSUSE zypper to Gentoo Linux，I will PR to [Gentoo-Zh](https://github.com/microcai/gentoo-zh) overlay. This one just for my tesing.

### Install zypper in Gentoo not means you could install openSUSE's rpm instead of them. But, I think you could try, if you got problem do not report here or openSUSE, because Gentoo and openSUSE are totally different. Zypper in here may be give you a hand to build openSUSE container in Gentoo Linux. So, I think maybe more could do, you tell me Geeks.
